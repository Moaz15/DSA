Binary Search is an efficient algorithm to find the position of a target element in a sorted 1D array. 
It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Prerequisites :

The array must be sorted (either ascending or descending).
Time Complexity: O(log n).

Binary search is only applicable in a sorted search space. 
The sorted search space does not necessarily have to be a sorted array. 
It can be anything but the search space must be sorted.

Lower Bound 
The lower bound of a value x in a sorted array is:
The index of the first element that is not less than x
